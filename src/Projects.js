The objective of the game is to eat as many pellets as possible while avoiding obstacles such as walls and the snake's own tail. The snake grows longer with each pellet eaten, making it more challenging to navigate. The game ends when the snake collides with an obstacle, and the player's score is determined by the number of pellets the snake consumes. Sneaky Snake is a fun and addictive game that is easy to play but difficult to master.",
